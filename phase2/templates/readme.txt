There are a lot to say about this exercise but basically, I created a homepage for addition and deletion about the hospital patients’ data. I created a button that can if press that goes into the other two pages and you can change the which web you are going to by the select list (using js, record the value from select and sent to button). And there’s add and delete page, I created an auto increment PID in flask and sent back to the add/delete page. Since the data was not appearing before the insert/delete, I also created an initial table value to send back all the needed result inside the database. Using flask to connect all the webpages, and using sqlite3 to create all the tables inside the functions of python. 
//use python “app.py” to start the web, the host is on the top
//the python code should be outside the template
